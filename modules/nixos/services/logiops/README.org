#+title: Logiops

* Known Issues
** ~logiops~ is out of date
Current ~nixpkgs~ version is 0.2.3, while upstream is 0.3.3

** service needs to be restarted on boot

The service probably starts too soon, but I haven't been able to fix it.
For now run:

#+begin_src bash
sudo systemctl restart logid.service
#+end_src
