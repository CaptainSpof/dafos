#+title: Emacs

* How to install
1. ensure ~config.dafos.apps.emacs.enable~ is set to ~true~, for both ~nixos~ and ~home~ modules
2. clone ~doom~: ~git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs~
3. install ~doom~: ~~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install~
4. (opt) ensure there isn't another Emacs configuration folder ~rm -rf ~/.emacs.d~
5. clone ~doom-conf~: ~git clone https://github.com/CaptainSpof/doom-conf~
6. sync configuration: ~doom sync -u~

* Known Issues

** Why no ~nix-doom-emacs~?

I decided to go with an "imperative" style configuration for Doom Emacs. Instead of using something like [[https://github.com/nix-community/nix-doom-emacs][nix-doom-emacs]].

The reasoning is that I can't be bothered to wait for a system rebuild to reload my configuration (I might be misunderstanding how nix-doom-emacs works).

** ~/Sync/Org doesn't exist

Until I decide if I port my ~syncthing~ configuration, we have to create the directory ourself:

#+begin_src bash
mkdir -pv ~/Sync/Org
#+end_src
